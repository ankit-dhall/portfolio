      <description>This project aims to implement a search engine using PySpark on Hadoop.
It portrays the use of PySpark to organize and index an entire dataset using TF-IDF and perform a search given a query.
This particular project utilizes Spark RDD&amp;rsquo;s as well as specialized Spark functions that can be leveraged to perform high-performance distributed computing.

      <description>This project analyzes and visualizes trip data of the Toronto Bike Share program in order to understand usage patterns and statitsics. Toronto Bike Share program caters to thousands of riders that make use of the bike rental service set up across multiple stations in and around the city of Toronto.
This analysis would potentially help the business understand it&amp;rsquo;s riders, usage patterns, user types, and potential pain points and use this information for the purposes of demand modelling to optimize costs and increase revenue and help improve customer experience.</description>

      <description>This project aims to implement a distributed architecture using python to implement similarity search on a given dataset.
Such an implementation can prove extremely useful in a variety of applications including finding similarities between genome sequences and retrieveing relevant information based on a given query.
This particular implementation works on a dataset containing Accident Information in the UK and can help businesses to search for relevant accident records based on a search criteria.</description>
