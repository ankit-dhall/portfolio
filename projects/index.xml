      <description>This research aims at applying a novel idea of utilizing an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) black-box model to predict the space heating demand of households in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
This research was conducted as a continuation of an ongoing study at the Ryerson Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems (CSES).
Being able to model and predict the space heating needs of a household can help reduce energy consumption, and in turn, reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions from households.</description>
